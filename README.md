# TE3270

This gem can be used to drive a 3270 terminal emulator.  You have to have a supported emulator installed on the
machines on which you use the gem.  Currently the only supported emulator is
[EXTRA! X-treme](http://www.attachmate.com/Products/Terminal+Emulation/Extra/xtreme/extra-x-treme.htm) by
Attachmate.  This is a commercial product and you will need to purchase it in order to use this gem.
We do plan to support other emulators as time permits.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'te3270'
